              One of the most difficult yet rewarding experiences of my life was
              founding a club while I was in college. As a sophomore who was
              deeply interested in data science. There was not a single student
              group focused on data science. I decided to start the VJ DATA
              QUESTERS Club (VJDQ) with the help of our department, motivated by
              my desire to have a real influence.{"\n"}
              {"\n"}
              With a lot of resolve and a distinct vision, the trip got
              underway. I put together a proposal to be given to the student
              activities office, wrote a mission statement, and listed the
              objectives of the organization. Convincing the administration of
              the club's potential influence and motivating students to join was
              a difficult first step. But what drove me was a deep-seated
              conviction that small steps taken by many could result in big
              changes.{"\n"}
              {"\n"}
              The next important step is to assemble a committed team. I reached
              out to colleagues who were passionate like me and gave them
              important roles in the club. We generated ideas and created an
              activity schedule together. Every event was painstakingly
              organized to guarantee optimal participation and influence. To
              keep club members motivated and involved, a combination of
              acknowledgment, passion, and human connection is needed. I made it
              a point to recognize everyone's participation, no matter how tiny,
              and to celebrate our group's accomplishments.{"\n"}
              {"\n"}Frequent meetings provided members with an opportunity to
              discuss ideas, express problems, and foster a sense of camaraderie
              in addition to planning and logistics. Everyone felt appreciated
              and motivated to participate because of the encouraging atmosphere
              we fostered. Our development was greatly aided by the
              administration's and the faculty's support. Through exhibiting the
              benefits of our work and proving our dedication, we were able to
              obtain funds and resources that allowed us to plan bigger events
              and take on more challenging initiatives. Faculty members offered
              their time to serve as advisors, offering advice and putting us in
              touch with outside organizations and subject matter experts.
              {"\n"}
              {"\n"}
              Reflecting on this journey, I am immensely proud of what the VJ
              DATA QUESTERS Club has achieved. From a fledgling idea to a
              vibrant, impactful organization, the club's success is a testament
              to the power of passion, perseverance, and collaboration. My
              motivation was fueled by the belief that together, we could make a
              difference. This belief not only drove me but also inspired
              countless others to join and support our mission.
              {"\n"}
              {"\n"}
              Looking ahead, the VJDQ is poised to continue its growth and
              impact. New leaders have emerged, bringing fresh ideas and energy.
              The foundation we built will support future initiatives, ensuring
              that our commitment to our club endures. Founding this club has
              been a transformative experience, teaching me invaluable lessons
              in leadership, teamwork, and the profound impact of collective
              action.
